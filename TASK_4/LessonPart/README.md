1. Create abstract class Animal, with abstract method sound()
2. Create class Dog and Cat that extends from class Animal.
3. In main method of class ZooKeeper: create Animal[] animals = new Animal[10];, and fill it randomly with 3 Dog objects and 3 Cat objects;After that program asks to enter some number between 0 and 10, if entered cell is not empty it must output what does this animal say, but if it is empty, it must say "NO SOUND. IT IS EMPTY"
4. Update class Animal: it should also have variable int hunger = 100; also it should have abstract method feed that receives String food;
