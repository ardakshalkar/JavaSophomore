P1: Create FarmFx file and let it extends Application.
Use JavaFX library, your program should output window with two label fields, and two buttons under it; First button will have icon of cat, and second icon of dog;
P2: You create two variables dogCount and catCount which are by default 0. When we press dog button it should increment dogCount by one, and when we press cat button it should increment catCount. Also it should update two label fields.
P2(advanced): Remove catCount and dogCount fields, and use instead of them HashMap<String,Integer>, where key will be animal name, and value will be amount of animals
P3: Create class Dog and Cat.
Create class Farm, which has two private fields dogCount and catCount. Also add public methods addCat, and addDog.
These two methods increments corresponding value.
P4: Update FarmFx class, let it have attribute Farm farm. So when you press Cat button, it calls addCat method of farm object, and when you press Dog button, it calls addDog method.
P5: Read from file farminfo.txt information about animals in farm, and display all of animals and their counts.

Don't do previous tasks and next tasks in one folder, because they will interfere each other.
H1: Create FarmFX class and let it extends Application
Your program should output three label fields, and four buttons: "Feed cow", "Feed sheep", "Sell cow", "Sell sheep". Last two buttons should be disabled.
H2: Create class Animal with method void feed(), availableToSell() and variables: hunger =100, weight;
Create class Cow and Sheep which extends Animal;
When we feed Cow it decreases hunger by 20, and increases weight by 10;
When we feed Sheep it decreases hunger by 30, and increases weight by 5;
When we don't feed Cow it increase hunger by 20, and when we don't feed Sheep it increase hunger by 35;
When hunger gets more than 100, it decreases weight by 3 for Sheep, and by 6 for Cow;
Sheep is availableToSell when it has weight 15, and Cow is when it has weight 25;
Sheep has price 10*weight, and cow has price 9*price;
Feeding Sheep costs 1 moneys, and feeding Cow costs 3 moneys;
Create class Farm, let it have next variables Cow cow, Sheep sheep, int money = 15;
Class Farm has methods: void sell(String animal),  
H3: First label shows amount of money, Second label shows info about cow, and third label shows info about sheep.
When we press buttons they call corresponding buttons. When cow or sheep is available to sell corresponding buttons are enabled.
When cow/sheep dies or is sold, corresponding feed button changes text to "Buy Cow" or "Buy Sheep", if there is not enough money these buttons are disabled.
